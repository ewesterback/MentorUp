### *Description*
Professional network that enables connections between those looking to mentor and those looking for a mentor.  This app is specifically targeted for underrepresented minorities within the STEM field.  Mentors can create a profile and indicate that they are available for mentees.  Mentees can create a profile and search for mentors drilling down by location and field.  Mentees can then choose to message the mentor to create a connection, and mentors and mentees can message each other on the platform.  

Also, both users can create job postings, search for job postings, and save job postings.  On their profile page, users can see all of their messages and saved jobs
