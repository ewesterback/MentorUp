### *Description*
Professional network that enables connections between those looking to mentor and those looking for a mentor.  This app is specifically targeted for underrepresented minorities within the Software Engineering field.  Mentors can create a profile and indicate that they are available for mentees.  Mentees can create a profile and search for mentors drilling down by location and field.  Mentees can then choose to message the mentor to create a connection, and mentors and mentees can message each other on the platform.
